Gybe Ho! Wind Notifier

This is the first stage of development of a web application, intended to pull data from selected
weather stations and notify users via a variety of methods (email, twitter, SMS, etc.) if the wind 
in their selected area exceeds a certain threshold. More features will be added over time, most
with the aim of offering greater configurability for individual users.

This project is intended both as a learning experience, and as a functional tool for myself and 
others who enjoy wind-dependent sports (sailing, windsurfing, etc.). The project is open source, and 
may be modified and incorporated in other works, in whole or in part, so long as credit is given where due.
